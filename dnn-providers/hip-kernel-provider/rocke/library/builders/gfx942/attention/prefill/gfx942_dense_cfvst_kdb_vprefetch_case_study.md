## Introduction

This optimization enables CFVST and implements K LDS Double Buffering and V register pre-fetching on D128 bf16 causual prefill attention gfx942 kernels. This reduces latency by 15% on various shapes. Lever sweep does not reduce latency anywhere close.

## Problem

Benchmarking, profiling and tracing highlighted bottlenecks in:
1. V read from LDS: V was stored in traditional layout in LDS. Bank conflicts occur during access.
2. Awkward allocation of LDS per WG (33KB). Max limit per CU is 64KB. This limits WG occupancy in CU to 1 while leaving 31KB of LDS unused.
3. Stalls at sync point for loading K and V tiles before MFMA.

The concerned optimization points were V LDS layout, register usage, LDS usage, software pipelining. We first tried to solve the issues by lever sweep. We selected levers relevant to the optimization points.
  
## Step-0 Lever Sweep

Lever sweep was performed to check whether performance could be improved by tuning levers to affect optimization points: **LDS usage/layout, software pipelining/scheduling, and register pressure**. Available levers are listed below along with reasons for selection decision and values swept.

| Field            | Swept | Relation to LDS / software pipelining / register usage                                                                                                                         | Values swept                               |
|------------------|-------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `block_m`        | Yes   | Changes workgroup/tile size and therefore affects LDS footprint, per-wave live state, register pressure, and scheduling granularity.                                           | `32, 64, 128, 256, 512`                    |
| `block_n`        | Yes   | Changes the K/V tile width, affecting LDS usage, loop trip count, load/compute cadence, and live register state.                                                               | `32, 64, 128`                              |
| `waves_per_eu`   | Yes   | Controls occupancy/scheduling pressure and helps test whether register pressure or insufficient latency hiding is limiting performance.                                        | `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8`                   |
| `lds_row_pad`    | Yes   | Directly changes the LDS layout/padding and can affect LDS bank behavior and address layout.                                                                                   | `0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32`          |
| `use_cfvst`      | Yes   | Changes the V-store/LDS path and therefore directly affects LDS traffic/layout; it can also change register lifetimes.                                                         | `False, True`                              |
| `use_v_swizzle`  | Yes   | Changes the V LDS layout/access pattern on the CFVST path and is directly relevant to LDS access behavior.                                                                     | `False`; `True` only when CFVST is enabled |
| `use_exp2_fast`  | Yes   | Primarily changes softmax computation, but can indirectly affect instruction count and temporary register usage.                                                               | `False, True`                              |
| `iglp`           | Yes   | Affects instruction scheduling inside the kernel by attempting to interleave MFMA and LDS operations. Relevant when CFVST introduces in-loop LDS traffic.                      | `False`; `True` only when CFVST is enabled |
| `persistent`     | No    | Controls whether the persistent grid is used. Affects grid-level scheduling/utilization, not the per-workgroup K/V LDS layout, register buffering, or software pipeline.      | —                                          |
| `num_persistent` | No    | Controls the number of persistent workgroups. Can affect device-level utilization and work distribution, but does not modify the inner K/V LDS/register software pipeline.    | —                                          |
| `persist_decode` | No    | Controls how persistent work items map to query blocks, heads, and batches. It affects grid-level work distribution rather than the inner LDS/register pipeline.              | —                                          |
| `interleave`     | No    | Controls boustrophedon query-block ordering for persistent causal workloads. It changes CTA work distribution, not instruction interleaving inside the K/V software pipeline. | —                                          |

The sweep therefore varied the following eight axes:

`block_m × block_n × waves_per_eu × lds_row_pad × use_cfvst × use_v_swizzle × use_exp2_fast × iglp`

The default domains were defined directly in the sweep harness, with applicability pruning for `use_v_swizzle` and `iglp` when CFVST was disabled.

`persistent`, `num_persistent`, `persist_decode`, and `interleave` were retained from the production-resolved configuration and recorded in the output for reproducibility, but were not varied by the Step-0 Cartesian search. These fields primarily control persistent-grid execution and work distribution rather than the inner LDS/register software pipeline targeted by this investigation.

#### Shapes Swept
The Step-0 lever sweep was run over the following BF16 D128 causal attention shapes:

| B  | S     | Hq | Hkv | D   |
|----|-------|----|-----|-----|
| 1  | 4096  | 32 | 8   | 128 |
| 1  | 4096  | 32 | 16  | 128 |
| 1  | 8192  | 32 | 8   | 128 |
| 1  | 8192  | 32 | 16  | 128 |
| 1  | 16384 | 32 | 8   | 128 |
| 16 | 4096  | 32 | 8   | 128 |
| 16 | 4096  | 32 | 16  | 128 |
| 16 | 8192  | 32 | 8   | 128 |

#### Results
None of the configurations improved performance to a satisfactorily.

## Optimization 1: Enable CFVST

V was stored in traditional layout in LDS. This caused bank conflicts during access. The hypothesis was that transposed layout would reduce bank conflicts. This feature was already present (CFVST) but disabled for bf16 due to register spillage concerns. Re-profiling found no register spillage. Infact performance improved substantially. Hence we adopted this optimization.

## Optimization 2 and 3: K LDS Double Buffering + V register pre-fetching

Analysis of stalls using threadtrace found a large number of waiting at sync points. One such point was waiting for K and V tiles to be loaded before MFMA. This wait restricted MFMA and memory loading parallelism. The hypothesis was that K LDS Double Buffering + V register pre-fetching would introduce parallelism and latency hiding. Both optimizations had to be implemented together because K and V load happens in parallel to each other. Optimizing 1 would leave other the bottleneck. The optimization improved performance substantially hence it was adopted.

## Results and Ablation Methodology
The complete experiment can be summarized as:

```text
1. Start one ROCKE/PyTorch process using one ROCm stack.
2. Obtain one current HIP stream.
3. Construct five compile-time specs:
      baseline
      cfvst
      cfvst_klds
      cfvst_vpf
      cfvst_klds_vpf
4. Run the Python emitter five times.
5. Compile five independent KernelDefs/LLVM modules/HSACOs. No runtime variant-selection branch exists in the GPU kernels.
6. Verify all five kernel names are unique.
7. Allocate one shared Q/K/V input set.
8. Construct one direct KernelLauncher per compiled kernel.
9. Build one chunked FP32 reference.
10. Validate all five kernels against that same reference.
11. Abort if correctness fails.
12. Warm all five kernels round-robin.
13. Synchronize.
14. Perform five measurement rounds.
15. Randomize the order of the five kernels in every round.
16. For each kernel in that round:
       record start event
       issue 50 direct KernelLauncher calls
       record end event
       synchronize end event
       divide elapsed GPU time by 50
17. Collect five round-level samples per kernel.
18. Take the median of those samples.
19. Compute same-session pairwise A/B ratios:
       baseline / cfvst
       cfvst / klds
       cfvst / vpf
       klds / full
       vpf / full
       baseline / full

20. Use those ratios to attribute the contribution of CFVST,
    KDB, VPF, and their interaction.
```
To obtain results on 8 shapes, we run the ablation on 8 shapes and pick necessary fields.
